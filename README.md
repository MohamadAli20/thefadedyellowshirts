“The faded yellow shirts” <br>
– ✍ Mohamad Ali Ambay Calanda <br>

I was bitten by many storms,<br>
While you stayed in cozy rooms.<br>
I need hands to lift me up,<br>
But I was pushed into a trap.<br>
<br>
Living on the same world,<br>
Bridges freeze, and it's cold<br>
Rough roads hinder my way.<br>
Message from: heart wants to say.<br>
<br>
Loving you is a gambling.<br>
In the arcade, horses are racing.<br>
Hidden words in song lyrics.<br>
And now we play ‘hide and seek’.<br>
<br>
I was programmed and trained,<br>
Like a dam, my heart is drained.<br>
Flood it with tears to forget,<br>
To wash away the day we met.<br>
<br>
The yellow shirt starts to fade,<br>
But, no one that I can blame.<br>
The umbrella starts to rust,<br>
And friendship fails to last.<br>
<br>
From friends become a lover,<br>
The pandemic said, “It's over.”<br>
Innocence turned violent,<br>
I thought you were a saint.<br>
<br>
The stars fall from the sky,<br>
A sign from me to say goodbye.<br>
Eyes and smile, I love to see,<br>
A calming sound: waves from the sea.<br>
