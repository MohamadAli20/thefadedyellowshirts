“The faded yellow shirts” <br>
– ✍ Mohamad Ali Ambay Calanda <br>

I was bitten by many storms,
While you stayed in cozy rooms.
I need hands to lift me up,
But I was pushed into a trap.

Living on the same world,
Bridges freeze, and it's cold
Rough roads hinder my way.
Message from: heart wants to say.

Loving you is a gambling.
In the arcade, horses are racing.
Hidden words in song lyrics.
And now we play ‘hide and seek’.

I was programmed and trained,
Like a dam, my heart is drained.
Flood it with tears to forget,
To wash away the day we met.

The yellow shirt starts to fade,
But, no one that I can blame.
The umbrella starts to rust,
And friendship fails to last.

From friends become a lover,
The pandemic said, “It's over.”
Innocence turned violent,
I thought you were a saint.

The stars fall from the sky,
A sign from me to say goodbye.
Eyes and smile, I love to see,
A calming sound: waves from the sea.
